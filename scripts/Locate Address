Locating an address can be useful if you're dealing with shipping or delivery logistics or for simple
user-profiling tasks. To get started, install geocoder by running pip install geocoder in your
terminal. The script below allows you to easily find the latitude and longitude coordinates for any
 address or to find an address from any set of coordinates:


Here is the CODE :

import geocoder
address = "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington DC USA"
coordinates = geocoder.arcgis(address)
geo = geocoder.arcgis(address)
print(geo.latlng)
# output: [38.89767510765125, -77.03654699820865]

# If we want to retrieve the location from a set of coordinates
# perform a reverse query.
geocoder.arcgis([38.89767510765125, -77.03654699820865], method="reverse")

# output: <[OK] Arcgis - Reverse [White House]>
