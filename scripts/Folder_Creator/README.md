# Problem

While automating system scripts sometimes we need to create folders.It can be tedious to make them manually and at different locations.

# Solution

This script allows us to create folder at one function call. Errors are handled to allow better user experience.

# How to run
Run the file in terminal
```
python3 folder.py
```
